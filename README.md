## Architecture Overview

**esynergy Open RAG** is a versatile framework designed to streamline the creation of RAG-based AI applications. By abstracting the complexities involved in setting up various components, it offers a simplified approach to developing sophisticated AI solutions. The framework allows developers to configure essential elements through environment variables, enabling rapid deployment and customization of Retrieve-Augment-Generate (RAG) systems. Here are the key components supported by the **esynergy Open RAG** framework:

- **Document Loaders**: These components facilitate the efficient ingestion and processing of vector data, ensuring that data from various sources can be easily integrated and utilized within the RAG environment.
- **Embeddings**: This module allows for the dynamic loading of different types of embeddings based solely on configuration settings defined in the environment variables. This flexibility supports a wide range of use cases and optimizations.
- **LLMs (Large Language Models)**: It provides mechanisms to load and deploy various language models according to the specific needs dictated by the environment settings. This adaptability ensures that the most appropriate computational resources are used for each task.
- **RAGs (Retrieve-Augment-Generate Systems)**: The framework supports multiple types of RAG configurations such as with_source, from_docs, or no_source, enabling developers to tailor the information retrieval and generation process to the specific demands of the application.
- **Retrievers**: Integrating seamlessly with popular databases and search engines such as Astra DB, Supabase, Elasticsearch, and OpenSearch, this module loads retriever objects that are crucial for efficient data retrieval in RAG systems.
- **Streamlit Components**: Dedicated components designed to facilitate the integration with the Streamlit platform, allowing for the swift development of user-friendly AI assistants and interactive elements within the application.

By providing these configurable modules, **esynergy Open RAG** empowers developers to build robust AI-driven applications with ease, focusing on innovation and customization without the burden of extensive setup processes.
